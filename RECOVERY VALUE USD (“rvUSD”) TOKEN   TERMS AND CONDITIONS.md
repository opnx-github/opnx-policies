SCHEDULE 1 – RISK DISCLOSURES \




1. **Specific Risk of the Token**

    rvUSD is a Token which has been issued pursuant to the ruling of the Supreme Court of Seychelles with respect to the restructuring of Liquidity Technologies Ltd (see https://coinflex.com/blog/coinflex-seychelles-approval-order).  


    Trading in tokenised debt instruments, such as rvUSD, carries inherent risks. When the debt issuer is involved in ongoing litigation and the debt is subject to dispute, these risks are heightened.  Potential investors should carefully consider the following risks before participating in such investments:


    _Legal uncertainty: _The outcome of the ongoing litigation is uncertain, and a negative ruling could negatively impact the value of the tokenised debt. Additionally, the legal status of tokenised debt may be unclear in certain jurisdictions, and regulatory changes could affect the value and liquidity of the investment.


    _Credit risk:_ If the counterparty defaults on its debt obligations or becomes insolvent, investors may lose some or all of their principal investment. The ongoing litigation and debt dispute may increase the likelihood of default or insolvency.


    _Liquidity risk:_ Tokenised debt instruments may be less liquid than traditional debt securities, making it more challenging to buy or sell the investment at a desirable price. Ongoing litigation and debt disputes may further decrease liquidity, as potential buyers may be deterred by the increased risks.


    _Price volatility:_ The market price of tokenised debt may be more volatile than traditional debt securities, as the market for tokenised debt is typically smaller and more susceptible to external factors. The ongoing litigation and debt dispute may contribute to increased price volatility.


    _Counterparty risk:_ As the counterparty is engaged in ongoing litigation and the debt is subject to dispute, there may be heightened counterparty risk. This could include the risk of fraudulent activity, mismanagement, or inadequate disclosure of relevant information.


    _Reputational risk:_ Investing in tokenised debt from a counterparty involved in litigation and subject to dispute may expose investors to reputational risk, as their association with the counterparty could negatively impact their own reputation.


    _Regulatory risk:_ Regulatory authorities may impose new laws or regulations, or change existing ones, which could have a material adverse effect on the value and liquidity of tokenised debt. The ongoing litigation and debt dispute may also attract regulatory scrutiny, increasing the likelihood of regulatory intervention.


    Before trading in tokenised debt, such as rvUSD, issued from a counterparty engaged in ongoing litigation and subject to dispute, you should carefully weigh these risks and consult with legal and financial advisors to determine whether such an investment aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.


    Our objective is to minimise such risks; however you should be aware that there is always the possibility that:


     \


1. LTL may not succeed in the legal actions against a defaulting manual margin agreement counterparty as described in the Term Sheet and there may be no proceeds or few proceeds to convert to USDC/USDT or to exchange for the Tokens as described in the Term Sheet.
2. The Deed of Assignment between the Company and LTL as described in the Term Sheet may not be enforceable.
3. The Company’s Trustee may terminate, modify or amend the Assignment or the Trustee may be replaced and a successor trustee may decide to terminate, modify or amend the Assignment. There may be a dispute between the Trustee and LTL. Recovery is contingent upon actual recovery and may result in little or no assets for exchange of the Tokens.
4. There may not be a market for the Tokens.
5. Like all cryptocurrencies, there is a high risk of losing all investment in the Tokens.

    As the exchange of the Token is contingent on recovery actions, there is a risk that there will be a need for litigation, arbitration, administrative or contentious proceedings in various jurisdictions with unpredictable outcomes.  There is always a possibility that such proceedings may be lengthy, costly or ultimately unsuccessful. There may be very few assets recovered in the recovery actions. 

2. **Risk of Unknowable or Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions:** 

    Regulation of tokens (including the Tokens), token offerings, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency exchanges is not yet mature and likely to rapidly evolve, varies significantly among different jurisdictions, and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various regulators, legislative and executive bodies may in the future adopt laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact the development and growth of the Platform and the adoption and utility of the Tokens. Failure by the Company or certain users of the Platform to comply with any laws, rules, and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines. As distributed ledger networks and distributed ledger assets have grown in popularity and in market size, regulatory agencies have begun to take an interest in and, in some cases, regulate their use and operation. To the extent that a domestic government or quasi-governmental agency exerts regulatory authority over a distributed ledger network or asset, the Platform and Tokens may be materially and adversely affected. Distributed ledger networks also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many jurisdictions such as Seychelles, Hong Kong, the United States, the European Union, China, and Russia. Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Platform. Such laws, regulations or directives may be in conflict with each other or may directly and negatively impact our business. The effect of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and materially adverse to the development and growth of the Platform and the adoption and utility of the Tokens. \
 \
New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, in relevant jurisdictions, may materially and adversely impact the value of the currency in which the Tokens may be exchanged, the liquidity and use of the Tokens, and the structure, rights, and transferability of Tokens.


     \


3. **Risks from Taxation **

    The tax characterisation of the Token is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with the acquisition, storage, transfer, and use of Token, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value added taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties, or other charges and tax reporting requirements.


     \


4. **Risks Associated with Data Privacy Laws**

    There are a number of data protection, security, privacy and other government- and industry-specific requirements, including those that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. Security compromises could harm the Platform’s reputation, erode user confidence in the effectiveness of its security measures, negatively impact its ability to attract new users, or cause existing users to stop using the Platform, which would reduce or diminish the utility of the Tokens and cause the Platform to fail.


     \


5. **Unanticipated Risks **

    Cryptographic tokens are a relatively new and untested technology. The Token, like all cryptographic tokens, may be in an illiquid market and subject to significant price volatility.  In addition to the risks discussed in these Terms, there are risks that the Company cannot anticipate. Further risks may materialise as unanticipated combinations or variations of the discussed risks or the emergence of new risks.
