At OPNX (**“We”**, **“Us”** and **“OPNX”**), we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

Capitalised terms not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings given in the Terms of Service.

This policy, together with the Terms of Service, explains how we may process any information that we collect from you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could identify you (**“Personal Information”**) and information that could not. In the context of the law and this policy, “process” means to collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on your Personal Information. Please read this policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your Personal Information and how we will treat it.

By disclosing your Personal Information to us, including, but not limited to, providing us with your Personal Data when using the Platform, contacting us by email, and speaking to us over the telephone, you hereby explicitly give your consent to us for the collection, storage, and processing of your Personal Information as stated in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to be bound by the following terms we regret that your only recourse is to stop using our Platform and services.

**What Personal Information do we collect?**

We may collect, store, and use the following kinds of Personal Information. All data collected will be stored for as long as the Personal Information is needed for its intended purpose as stated below. To comply with relevant law or regulation, we will also keep a copy of the Personal Information for archival purposes for a minimum of seven years.

If you register as a user of the Platform, you will be asked to complete an application which will require you to provide your personal details, including, but not limited to, your name, address, email address, a proof of identity, and a proof of address.

When you contact us, by email, telephone, or through any contract form provided by us, we may ask you to provide some or all of the information set out in the paragraph above. We keep personally identifiable information associated with your message, such as your name and email address, so as to be able to track our communications with you to provide a high quality service;

We may collect, store, and use information about your computer, mobile device or other item of hardware through which you access the Platform and your visits to and use of the Platform (including, without limitation, your IP address, geographical location, browser/platform type and version, Internet Service Provider, operating system, referral source/exit pages, length of visit, page views, Platform navigation, and search terms that you use);

We collect data regarding your deposits, withdrawals and trades on our Platform along with any provided bank details and cryptocurrency wallet addresses. For more information on our use of cookies, please see our cookies notice.

We may, from time to time, ask you to complete surveys and give feedback which we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond.

**How do we use personal information?**

We may use your Personal Information for the following purposes:



* To manage and administer the Platform;
* To improve your browsing experience by personalising the Platform;
* To enable you to use the Platform;
* To send you newsletters and other relevant and targeted promotional communications;
* To deal with enquiries, complaints, and feedback from you and our service providers;
* To provide third parties with statistical anonymised information about our users;
* To publish generic transactional information relating to trades undertaken using the OPNX platform;
* To perform compliance checks;
* To send you emails offering you to take part in surveys and/or to give feedback;
* To analyse and improve the services offered on the Platform.

**When might we disclose personal information?**

Except to the extent required by any applicable law or governmental, regulatory, or judicial body, we will not disclose your Personal Information to any third party other than to a service provider to whom we are required to disclose personal information in order for them to provide their services to us.

OPNX may use a qualified third party to perform anti-money laundering checks and other necessary and appropriate checks on you. In order for the third party to do this, OPNX will disclose documentation containing personal information about you, including, without limitation, your proof of identity.

Where we use a third party service provider to process your Personal Information, we will require such service provider to comply with relevant personal data privacy laws and regulations and/or contractually by use of data protection agreements.

**Newsletters and other promotional communications**

If you wish to subscribe to any newsletter published by us or wish to receive other targeted and relevant promotional communications from us or other carefully chosen affiliates, we offer you the option to ‘opt-in’ to this service. If you change your mind and wish to stop receiving any such communications, please click the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any email from us.

**How we protect your Personal Information**

We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. We take all reasonable endeavours to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect your Personal Information. As part of this, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates to verify our identity to your browser and to encrypt any data you give us.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and so we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted through the Platform. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your Personal Information, we use strict procedures and security features in an effort to prevent unauthorised access.

**Retention period for personal information**

We keep your personal information for as long as the Personal Information is needed for its intended purpose. We may also keep a copy of your Personal Information for archival purposes for a minimum period of seven years to comply with laws and regulations, and to support any potential legal claims.

**Review of this privacy policy**

This Policy will be reviewed from time to time and may be changed without notice. Any information held will be governed by our most current Privacy Policy.
